    <p>When you become a member of our association, by filling in the registration form (either a physical form or on our website), you give us permission to store and process your personal information. We will keep this data until you resign as a member, unless specified otherwise in this document.</p>
    <h2 id="what-data-we-store-and-why">What data we store and why</h2>
    <p>This section describes the personal information of our members that we store. Only the board members and the members of the <code>compucie</code> committee, which is the committee responsible for maintaining our digital facilities, have direct access to this data. Sometimes a committee will request the names and email addresses of participants for an activity. In this case it is the responsibility of the board to decide whether they should share the data with the committee.</p>
    <h3 id="personal-information">Personal information</h3>
    <p>We store <em>first and family names, birthdate, gender and nationality</em>. Gender and nationality are only used for statistics, that is we're interested in knowing male/female or the national/international student ratio in our associataion. We will never share your personal information with third parties without your explicit consent. We do share statistics with the University of Groningen and partner companies (see <em>third parties</em>).</p>
    <h3 id="contact-information">Contact information</h3>
    <p>To be able to contact you we need your <em>email address</em>. Additionally when registering you can opt in to share your home address and phone number.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Email address</p>
            <p>We use your email address to send you bi-weekly newsletters about our association and invitations or informative emails about activities organized by our association. When an email needs to be sent to participants of an activity we will share the email addresses of the participants with the committee members that organize said activity.</p></li>
        <li><p>Home address</p>
            <p>We use your home address (if you have a subscription) to send a physical copy of our magazine, the <em>Francken Vrij</em>, and promotional material (flyers) for important events.</p></li>
        <li><p>Phone number</p>
            <p>We sometimes use your phone number to contact you if you've signed up for an event but aren't present yet.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="study-information">Study information</h3>
    <p>As a study association we want to know our member's studies. Hence we store your student number and your (current) study. We share the statistics with the university and partner companies so that they can get an idea of what the members of our association are studying.</p>
    <h3 id="photos">Photos</h3>
    <p>Photos taken at our activities are stored on our own server. After reviewal of the photos they are published on our website. Members can contact <a href="mailto:fotociefrancken@gmail.com">the Fotocie</a> or the board about removal of these photos.</p>

    <p>It may happen that we require additional information when you want to participate at one of our activities.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Curriculum vitae</p>
            <p>At some activities we require your curriculum vitae (CV). For instance when we organize an activity with a company for a limited amount of participants. When you register for such an activity we ask you to share your CV so that we can make a selection of members that are allowed to participate at the activity. This selection can either be done by the association or the company that organizes the activity. In the latter case we anonymise your data to both reduce biases in the selection process <strong>and</strong> to protect your personal data. We will delete your CV within four weeks after the activity.</p></li>
        <li><p>Identification</p>
            <p>When organizing a (foreign) excursion we often need a copy of a identifcation document (a passport, identification card or drivers license). When you register for such an event you will be asked to share this document. We advise you to use <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs">KopieId</a> to make a copy of your identification document. The digital copy that we get will be stored on our own server that is only accessible by the board or <code>compucie</code> members. We will delete these copies within four weeks after the excursion, unless we are required by law to keep these copies for a longer period of time in which case we will inform you about this decision.</p></li>

    <p>To keep track and deduct your expenses at Francken, the registration form gives you the option to provide your International Bank Account Number (IBAN).

            <p>If you'd like to purchase food and drinks in our members room you'll have to opt in into our canteen system (more commonly known as the <em>streepsystem</em>).
