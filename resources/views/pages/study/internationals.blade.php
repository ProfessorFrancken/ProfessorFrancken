        For your first time, you must go to the  language center (in the city) and talk to the person in charge.
        Lessons are usually held in Harmonie building next to academic building in the city center.
    </p>

    <h2 id="introduction-camp" class="mb-1 mt-4">Introduction camp</h2>

        It is held on the weekend before university starts.

    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <a href="https://www.esn.org/" title="Erasmus Student Network" class="font-weight-bold">ESN</a> has an introduction week which is mainly held for internationals.
        Held for a week starting from the weekend before university starts to a few days into the first week of classes.
        Close to a thousand students from different faculties join every year.
        It is a great way to meet internationals within different faculties and get to know Groningen city.
        It gets a little hectic when pub crawling in large groups but people find their way around eventually with different groups.
        More information about esn can be found on <a href="https://www.esn-groningen.nl/">their website</a>.
    </p>

        It's quite similar to the ESN introduction week but this is less internationally themed and is held in the middle of August, before you start worrying about your studies.
        You get two KEI parents who will be responsible for your group. They also try to put you in groups with similar interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all joining an introduction camp is quite a great way to build new bonds in a new city.

    <h2 id="health-insurrance" class="mb-1 mt-4">Health insurrance</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">
        If you are from the EU, health insurance will not be a problem, your national insurance will be accepted in the same way as the Dutch national health insurance.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        If you are not from the EU then <a href="https://www.aonstudentinsurance.com/students/en/" class="font-weight-bold">AON</a>, the health insurance for students abroad, is a good choice.
        AON offers different levels of insurance according to the situation and their website lets you type some information about your needs and it will suggest the best plan for the situation.
        The most expensive is 40 euros a month and covers everything except pre-existing conditions, which is significantly cheaper than the Dutch national health insurance.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The <a href="https://www.studentarts.nl/" class="font-weight-bold">student doctor</a> accepts both EU health insurance and AON and it is quite convenient as it is located on campus.
        If you have a (part-time) job, you are obliged to take out a Basic Healthcare insurance.
        Also when you have a paid internship, and you earn more that € 150,- per month and € 1.500,- per year, you should take out a Basic Healthcare insurance.
    </p>

    <h2 id="job-advice" class="mb-1 mt-4">Job advice</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">
        If you work 56 hours a month and you are from the EU, you are entitled to apply for another loan on top of your tuition fee loan and get ~€950 from the Dutch government every month if you show them your paycheck for the 56 hours and your bank bank statement.
        You show them these details in a building located at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kempkensberg+12,+9722+TB+Groningen/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c82d54700bdff3:0xd6c015e2e4f2d074?ved=2ahUKEwiu_4mx5sPgAhUGU1AKHQneD6gQ8gEwAHoECAAQAQ" class="font-weight-bold">Kempkensberg 12, 9722 TB</a> and you shall find that you may not need to go every month, so you could go once and claim the last three months and receive a lot of money.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Please be aware that you can work if you are not from the eu but it's a low amount of hours, you have to get special visa requirements and is generally seen as a big hassle, but it is possible.
        You also can't get any loans from the dutch government in the non eu citizen case even if you work.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Working 14 hours a week may not seem like much but it is, however people can and do actually finance their university by themselves like this.
        Please be aware that it is rather difficult to get a job in the Netherlands without speaking Dutch.
        However it is possible to find a job as a food delivery driver, waitor, or pot washer to name a few, without speaking Dutch. <br/>

        Please note that you need special health insurance as you are now a citizen who works, see <a href="https://www.aansprakelijkheidsverzekering.org/eng/compare-liability-insurance/">aansprakelijkheidsverzekering.org</a> for more information.

        Don't buy a bike when someone offers you one for very cheap in the city centre, it's probably stolen.
        You should probably try to get one with with hand breaks because it is easier to use if you never tried using pedal brakes but it it not difficult getting used to it.
        Swapfiets can be more expensive but if some damage happens to the bike it will get replaced or fixed anywhere in the city for free.
        Remember to always have lights if you're cycling after dark because you could get fined if you don't (and it's safer!), you can buy lights in most stores like HEMA, Flying Tiger or So Low.
